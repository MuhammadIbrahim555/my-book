# Chapter 1: AI & Robotics Fundamentals

## Overview

Welcome to Chapter 1 of "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics". This chapter introduces you to the fundamental concepts that form the building blocks of AI and robotics. Whether you're completely new to the field or looking to solidify your foundational knowledge, this chapter provides a comprehensive introduction to the core principles that underlie physical AI systems.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Define key terminology in AI and robotics
- Identify the main components of humanoid robots
- Explain how AI algorithms interact with physical systems
- Understand the basic principles of robot control and sensing
- Recognize the applications of humanoid robots in various contexts

## Chapter Structure

This chapter is organized into three lessons that progressively build your understanding:

1. [Lesson 1: Introduction to AI](./lesson-1-introduction-ai/index.md) - Explore what AI is, why it matters for physical systems, and its foundational concepts
2. [Lesson 2: Robot Components](./lesson-2-robot-components/index.md) - Understand the essential parts that make up humanoid robots
3. [Lesson 3: Basic Programming](./lesson-3-basic-programming/index.md) - Learn fundamental programming concepts for robotics

## Prerequisites

This chapter requires no prior knowledge of AI or robotics. Basic computer literacy is sufficient to begin. All concepts are explained from first principles.

## Projects in This Chapter

To reinforce your learning, complete the hands-on projects included in this chapter:

- [Project 1: First Robot](./projects/project-1-first-robot.md) - Build a simple conceptual model of a robot
- [Project 2: Sensor Input](./projects/project-2-sensor-input.md) - Explore how robots perceive their environment

## Navigation Tips

- Use the sidebar to jump between lessons and projects
- Complete each lesson before moving to the next
- Don't skip the exercises in each lesson - they're designed to reinforce key concepts
- Work through the projects to apply your knowledge in practical ways

Let's begin with [Lesson 1: Introduction to AI](./lesson-1-introduction-ai/index.md), where we'll explore the fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence and why they matter for physical systems.
