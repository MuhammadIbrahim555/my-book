## Prompt

```
/sp.implement implement in 001-book-spec you have already this folder and update this
```

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book according to the specifications. Completed all tasks from the tasks.md file including:

1. Setup Phase: Configured Docusaurus project with appropriate settings
2. Foundational Phase: Implemented navigation, styling, and content templates
3. User Story 1: Created Chapter 1 with 4 lessons and 2 projects
4. User Story 2: Added additional lessons and projects focused on complex control
5. User Story 3: Created introduction section and tutorials including quickstart guide
6. Polish Phase: Completed documentation updates, validation, and optimization

The implementation includes:
- Complete Docusaurus-based documentation site
- Chapter 1: AI & Robotics Fundamentals with 4 lessons and 5 projects
- Introduction section and tutorials
- Proper navigation and search functionality
- Beginner-friendly approach with real-world applications
